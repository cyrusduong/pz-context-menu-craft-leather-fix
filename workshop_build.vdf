	"description"		"A Project Zomboid Build 42 fix for broken drying rack mechanics (Leather and Plants).

This is a temporary MP-compatible stop-gap until the passive drying UI is finalized by the developers. Adds [b]Dry Leather[/b] and [b]Dry Herbs[/b] context menu options to drying racks for processing items. Supports all vanilla leather types and various herbs/tobacco with strict rack size validation.

Full Multiplayer support.

[i]Note: This is a temporary fix mod intended to restore functionality until the official Build 42 crafting system is fully stabilized.[/i]
